SDK / Frontend Integration Tips

* Handle 404 and 500 errors properly
* Send JSON payloads as shown above
* Use `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE` methods only (for now)

Dev Notes

* Make sure `data.db` gets created in the project folder. 
* You can manually inspect the DB using `flask shell` or a SQLite viewer.
* Can be extended easily with `PUT` / `PATCH` for updates.
